    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Boxing</h2>
    I love boxing because it helps me manage my stress and allows me to learn 
    how to defend myself. This has helped me overcome my trauma of bullying when i was 
    younger. To learn how to fight for myself has instilled in me a sense of confidence
    wherever I go. 

    <h2>Anime</h2>
    Anime has also taught me intrinsic values such as hardwork,determinatio and grit.
    Although the story is fictional, there is nothing fictional about the benefits that it brings to society as it 
    pushes people to always do their best and never give up until you become the next hokage! 

    <h2>Dota</h2>
    Dota has been my addiction ever since junior college ended. I always strive to reach immortal rank one day.
    It has taught me to not always blame others and to only focus on what I can do. It also taught me to 
    adapt to my environment.
